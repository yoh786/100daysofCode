##DAY 002

- This was written using VIM in the .git Bash TTY Emulator. So I believe that is an accomplishment in-and-of itself. **(ver2. That was really cool, and it taught us a lot. I also like what you are doing now with moving back to a local builder and beautiful OS - shoutout to my forever bae Ubuntu being fresh again)**

- It's unfortunate how much you forget when not actively using knowledge. It's also gratifying how much easier ti was to pick up a second time - so that's a plus.

- I like the feel of this netbook. *Spoiler: It's even better with Linux*
  - God the flat material design aesthetic I got going here makes me happy.
  - Background should be that one we haddddddd..... noooooooooo...
