DAY 002
=======

- This was written using VIM in the .git Bash TTY Emulator. So I believe that is an accomplishment in-and-of itself.

- It's unfortunate how much you forget when not actively using knowledge. It was much easier to pick up the second time though so that's a plus.

- **Configured EC2**: we made a compute and dev platform via AWS that we can employ to run longform dev tasks on a cloud. While retaining the usability of Windows as a desktop. Also this frees up the meager system resources that this device actually has. Mobile app development may be tricky and we may move to a fully fleshed out IDE for that use case but until then this should be quite useful to me. 

- I like the feel of this netbook.

- not a lot of hard code today but we should start that up tomorrow. Also, move forward w/ cybersecurity training.

- need to get books all together and move them to this laptop. also get storage solution as there is only 4GB left on this device (paltry)
