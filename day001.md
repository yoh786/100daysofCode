##DAY 001

- **Getting setup**: So far, we've gotten our favorite text editor and also git. Need to get projects moved over and get working w/ tools. Should be doing dev on Amazon Web server because that low key makes a lot of sense. We've put together some social but need to reset the pass for twitter.

This is from the future now. It's been 5 months since I created this repo originally. The struggle has been real and a long time coming. I'm honest here: *I've never been happier or healthier, and for that I am infinitely grateful*

  - as far as the hardware and software side go, I've got this fancy new Ubuntu netbook and so much to explore :). Super happy with this laptop though, especially now. Linux makes it snappy and beautiful.

- **Making Goals, Building processes**: Documentation is key. Take it day by day. Build blocks. Establish clear projects w/ set goals and scope.

TODAY
------
Good start.
Habits are earned via diligence and consistency.

**Goal init:**
Write something for day 2. Create functional code for CheckMarc.
