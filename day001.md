##Day 1

- **Getting setup**: So far, we've gotten our favorite text editor and also git. Need to get projects moved over and get working w/ tools. Should be doing dev on Amazon Web server because that low key makes a lot of sense. We've put together some social but need to reset the pass for twitter.

- **Making Goals, Building processes**: Documentation is key.

TODAY
------
We did a good job of getting something functional up and running and keeping it lean. Key now will be to continue good habits and create things to do that are big projects and breaking them down to build.
