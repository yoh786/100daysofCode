# 100daysofCode

This is my .git to track my 100 day journey!

*- Peter C# Parker*

-------------

**Rules are:**

1. Post every day, even if it's minor ( need to figure out format and goals ); also supplement with Tumblr.
2. 1 hour dedicated to learning; keep your notes together
3. Have fun! go back to the beginning :)
