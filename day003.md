##DAY 003

Diving further into that self resolve extension. Also check back in with that Python curriculum. (low key it's probably out)
- Starting out by actually following the tutorial on the developer page for Google.

**some notes:**
- all extensions require manifest files. The files is a json type. The manifest file itself does not do very much.

END:
Did end up getting some real coding in. Discovered doing checkmarc may be more difficult than initially expected. Specifically, it tends to sloppy load the names and reload the list to make it smaller. Probably for overhead.

Going forward:
I'd like to get a social presence going, possibly a Coder instagram and get the twitter back for Peter C# Parker.
