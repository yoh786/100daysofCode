##DAY 004

*3-19*

**Time to set some ground rules**

1. To complete a day you must: Code AND Record. Doing work without recording it does not count. The journal entries don't have to be super elaborate, but they must be meaningful.

2. Date your entries.

3. Focus. Do one project at a time. Complete a project before moving on to the next.

4. Use git. Use git often. Use git correctly.

5. Supplementary work educating on proper development and project management.

learned some more about the Atom editor (which has definitely become my favorite [poo poo sublime text, no offense] text editor); Some useful Keyboard Shortcuts..

- Ctrl-\ : toggles tree view

- Ctrl-Shift-9 : toggles the git tab

- Ctrl-Shift-P : pulls up the command search - can do most things right from here

- Ctrl-Alt-(period.) : closes current tag
