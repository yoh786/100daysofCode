##DAY 004

*3-19*

**Time to set some ground rules**

1. To complete a day you must: Code AND Record. Doing work without recording it does not count. The journal entries don't have to be super elaborate, but they must be meaningful.

2. Date your entries.

3. Focus. Do one project at a time. Complete a project before moving on to the next.

4. Use git. Use git often. Use git correctly.

5. Supplementary work educating on proper development and project management.
